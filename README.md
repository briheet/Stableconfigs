# Dotfiles

These are all my dotfiles that are stable at the moment.
Would be upgrading them from time to time idk.

Please be sure you have some basic knowledge of how things work before cloning to avoid issues.

Recently cloned it and replaced with new i3 had issues, do nvim and then do it manually.

Sorry guys, i am back to plain arch
